/**
 * Hackathon demo fallback for the brain's LLM endpoint.
 *
 * So lyra runs out of the box with **no personal API key**: when neither
 * `OPENAI_API_KEY` nor `LYRA_LLM_API_KEY` is set, the CLI and gateway route
 * through this hosted, key-capped, rate-limited proxy (it holds the real key
 * server-side). Users who set their own key bypass this entirely.
 *
 * NOTE: this is a public demo endpoint for the Sui Turing Test 2026. Remove
 * or rotate it after the event (it gates a shared, spend-capped OpenAI key).
